## Overview
**iDragon** is a fun, browser-based JavaScript game where you control a dino to avoid oncoming dragons and score points. The game is inspired by classic endless runner games and designed to be engaging, visually appealing, and easy to play.  

Players use the **arrow keys** to jump or move left/right to dodge obstacles, while the game keeps track of their score in real-time.
